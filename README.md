The goal of the Adult Census Income Prediction Project is to create a machine learning model that uses job and demographic characteristics from the Adult dataset from the U.S. Census Bureau to forecast if an individual's annual income surpasses $50,000. 
Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation are some of the crucial processes in this project.
Various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNeighbor Classifier,Decision Trees and Random Forests are tested and optimized using techniques to find the best hyperparameters.
